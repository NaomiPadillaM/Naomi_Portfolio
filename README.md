# Naomi Portfolio
Porfolio of my most important Data Science projects

# [Project 1: Heart Failure Predictions](https://github.com/NaomiPadillaM/Heart-Failure-Predictions.git)
* Data cleaning and pretreatment using pandas and numpy in order to verify de data type and the non-presence of any null data.
* Statistical analysis for each feature, their distribution and correlation.
* Use of Sklearn *Principal Component Analysis (PCA)* and *StandarScaler* for the standarization of the data.
* Use of *train_test_split* for the training of all the used supervised learning models.
* Attempt to predict a _heart failure_ using **Support Vector Machine**, **Decision Tree**, **Neuronal Network**, **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest** and **K-Nearest Neighbours** using the confusion matrix for the evaluation of each model.
* Use of _matplotlib_ for all the visualization.

Me gusta mucho programar


# [Project 2: Life-Expectancy](https://github.com/NaomiPadillaM/Life-Expectancy.git) 
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
